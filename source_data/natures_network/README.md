# SECAS Southeast Conservation Blueprint Inputs - North Atlantic Nature's Network Conservation Design

`NaturesNetwork_conservdesign_180625.tif` was downloaded 10/14/2020 from USFWS staff MS Teams site.

Data were processed using `analysis/prep/prepare_natures_network.py`.

## Indicators

Indicator data were downloaded on 3/2/2021 from http://naturesnetwork.org/data-tools/download-tables/

Habitat Condition for Imperiled Species was available in that package as a FGDB Raster (unreadable). However, it is available as a GeoTIFF within the SD file at: https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/58a75b0ee4b025c464286d63 so that was used instead. (Note: this is in web mercator projection)

TODO: future phase, acquire clean Habitat Condition from Nature's Network contacts.

A subset of the overall data were pulled for use as indicators:

- Cores (described below)
- Imperiled species habitat condition
- Imperiled species habitat importance
- Aquatic integrity
- Integrity
- Freshwater resilience by watershed

### Aquatic, Terrestrial, and Imperiled Species Cores

These were extracted from the NaturesNetwork_conservdesign_180625.tif
