    "description": "This indicator measures the condition of migratory fish habitat along the Atlantic coast within each catchment, using metrics of water quality, aquatic connectivity, habitat fragmentation, flow alteration, and more. Areas of excellent fish habitat are already in good condition and face few threats. Restoration opportunity areas are doing well in some respects, but restoration projects could significantly improve them. Degraded areas of opportunity face many challenges, and restoration projects are unlikely to increase available fish habitat unless particularly large in scope and scale. This indicator originates from the Atlantic Coast Fish Habitat Partnership's fish habitat conservation area mapping and prioritization project.",

    "description": "This indicator identifies areas with pine trees that, if managed for open condition, could support a population of three umbrella bird species (brown-headed nuthatch, Bachman's sparrow, red-cockaded woodpecker). It evaluates potential habitat in the West Gulf Coastal Plain/Ouachitas (WGCPO) Bird Conservation Region based on each species' habitat needs and population dynamics, prioritizing opportunities to restore and manage habitat to benefit open pine birds. Final scores reflect both the selectiveness of the species and whether an area meets the habitat requirements through one large patch, or clusters of smaller patches in sufficiently close proximity for breeding pairs to disperse. This indicator updates the Lower Mississippi Valley Joint Venture's open pine decision support model for the WGCPO region.",

As a non-migratory bird endemic to the Gulf coast, mottled ducks serve as good indicators of coastal marsh health and function. Urban growth, agricultural development, and hydrologic changes due to human alteration and climate change have caused significant mottled duck habitat loss and population declines. This indicator originates from a mottled duck decision support tool developed by the Gulf Coast Joint Venture.",
