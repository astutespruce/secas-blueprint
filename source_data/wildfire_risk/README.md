# Wildfire Risk to Communities

Wildfire risk to communities data (RDS-2020-0016-2\_\_BP_CONUS.zip) were downloaded 12/18/2024 from https://www.fs.usda.gov/rds/archive/catalog/RDS-2020-0016-2.

The data were downloaded by state because the national dataset kept timing out.

Thresholds, labels, and colors were provided by Hilary Morris via email on 1/23/2025.
