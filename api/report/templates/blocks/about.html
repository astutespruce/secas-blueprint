<h2 id="About">About the Blueprint</h2>

<p>
    The Southeast Conservation Blueprint is the primary product of the
    Southeast Conservation Adaptation Strategy (SECAS). It is a living,
    spatial plan that identifies important areas for conservation and
    restoration across the Southeast and Caribbean. The Blueprint stitches
    together smaller subregional plans into one consistent map,
    incorporating the best available information about key species,
    ecosystems, and future threats. More than 1,700 people from 500
    different organizations have actively participated in its development
    so far.
