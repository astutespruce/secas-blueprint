    <h2 id="Corridors">Hubs and Corridors</h2>

    <p>
        This area does not overlap with any hubs or corridors.
        <br /><br />
        The Blueprint uses a least-cost path connectivity analysis to identify corridors that link hubs across the shortest distance possible, while also routing through as much Blueprint priority as possible.
