# SECAS Southeast Conservation Blueprint Explorer - Constant values

## Inputs

Input area priority categories were derived from the [SE Blueprint Development Process](https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/file/get/5f85ac8282cebef40f14c545?name=SE_Blueprint_2020_DevelopmentProcess.pdf).

Colors were assigned to better align into groups with high and medium conservation value.

These colors were derived from:

- High conservation value: https://colorbrewer2.org/#type=sequential&scheme=Greens&n=6
- Medium conservation value: https://colorbrewer2.org/#type=sequential&scheme=Purples&n=6
- Not high or medium: https://colorbrewer2.org/#type=sequential&scheme=Greys&n=8

Values were based on relative approximations in the range of colors available.
