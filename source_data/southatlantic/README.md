# SECAS Southeast Conservation Blueprint Inputs - South Atlantic Conservation Blueprint 2020

Prepared using `analysis/prep/prepare_southatlantic.py`

## Notes

Most indicators and the Blueprint are mapped at a resolution of 30m.

The 3 marine and 1 estuarine indicators were originally mapped at 200m. These were
resampled to 30m by USFWS staff for consistency with the other indicators and provided separately.

The final Blueprint 2021 data were posted by USFWS to https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/file/get/607f1b76d34e8564d6809f2f?name=Blueprint_2021_Data_Download.zip
on 8/25/2021.

Binned versions of continuous indicators were prepared by USFWS and sent separately on 8/25/2021.
