Areas of excellent fish habitat are already in good condition and face few threats. Restoration opportunity areas are doing well in some respects, but restoration projects could significantly improve them. Degraded areas of opportunity face many challenges, and restoration projects are unlikely to increase available fish habitat unless particularly large in scope and scale. This indicator originates from the Atlantic Coast Fish Habitat Partnership's fish habitat conservation area mapping and prioritization project.",

    "description": "This indicator depicts marshes and grasslands along the coast of Louisiana and Texas that are important for mottled duck nesting, based on key biological parameters such as patch size, land cover type, and distance to brood rearing habitat. As a non-migratory bird endemic to the Gulf coast, mottled ducks serve as good indicators of coastal marsh health and function. Urban growth, agricultural development, and hydrologic changes due to human alteration and climate change have caused significant mottled duck habitat loss and population declines. This indicator originates from a mottled duck decision support tool developed by the Gulf Coast Prairie Landscape Conservation Cooperative.",
