These included four physical properties (stream network length, number of size classes, number of gradients classes and number of temperature classes), and three condition characteristics (risk of hydrologic alterations, natural cover in the floodplain, and amount of impervious surface in the watershed). Because biota and physical processes are linked to the size of bodies of water, watersheds of stream networks which contain a variety of stream and lake sizes are expected to be more resilient by providing varied habitats and refugia, allowing native species to persist.
