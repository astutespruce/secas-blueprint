      "description": "This indicator measures the condition of estuarine fish habitat along the Atlantic coast. It incorporates metrics of water quality, marsh edges, seagrass and oyster reefs, fragmentation, human development, and more. Areas of excellent fish habitat are already in good condition and face few threats; restoration opportunity areas are doing well in some respects, but restoration projects could significantly improve them; degraded areas of opportunity face many challenges, and restoration projects are unlikely to increase available fish habitat unless particularly large in scope and scale."

      "description": "Marine mammals is a continuous index of dolphin and whale density based on monthly density predictions for ten species of cetaceans and yearly density predictions for three rarer cetacean species (monthly: North Atlantic right whale, sperm whale, Sei whale, humpback whale, fin whale, bottlenose dolphin, short-beaked common dolphin, Risso’s dolphin, harbor porpoise, Atlantic white-sided dolphin; yearly: pilot whale, beaked whale, striped dolphin). Marine mammals help identify key areas of ocean productivity and overall ocean health because they have long life spans, feed at high trophic levels, and can accumulate anthropogenic chemicals and toxins in their large blubber stores."

Hardbottom provides an anchor for important seafloor habitats such as deep-sea corals, plants, and sponges. Many deep-sea corals form tree-like shapes and complex reefs that provide valuable habitat structure. Hardbottom and associated deep-sea coral communities support a wide range of invertebrate and fish species."
