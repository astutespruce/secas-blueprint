    <p>
        The Blueprint stitches together smaller subregional plans into one
        consistent map, incorporating the best available information about the
        current condition of key species and habitats, as well as future
        threats.

        Where these subregional plans overlap, the following rules were used:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Only include an input if known uses of that Blueprint input have
                occurred in the overlap zone
            </li>
            <li>
                If an overlap zone has no known use for any Blueprint input,
                only include the most well-established input
            </li>
        </ul>
