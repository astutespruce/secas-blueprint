Data were downloaded 9/12/2024 from https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/file/get/66c8c319d34e0338828bab54?name=Southeast_Blueprint_2024_Data_Download.zip.

A separate XLSX file containing indicator descriptions and other details was
downloaded from USFWS MS Teams internal site on 9/5/2024.

Subregions were downloaded 9/12/2024 from https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/65fb224cd34e64ff1548cd77
These share the same boundaries as the ones included in the official data package
but include a few subdivisions of subregions that are useful in this app.
