Downloaded 10/14/2020 from USFWS staff MS Teams site.

Data were processed using `analysis/prep/prepare_caribbean.py`.

Per the SE Blueprint integration rules, the top 8 priority (metric_ran) watersheds
were assigned to high conservation value and top 9-12 were assigned to medium conservation value.

The maximum rank is 24.

Since data were processed by HUC10, these can be joined to the HUC10 component of overlapping HUC12 summary units.
