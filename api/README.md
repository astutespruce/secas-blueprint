# Southeast Conservation Blueprint Simple Viewer - API

## Overview

Use case: user uploads shapefile (AOI) representing a small area, this generates a custom PDF report including maps and summaries of overlap with Blueprint and other data.

## Starting background jobs and API server

### Development environment

Background jobs use `arq` which relies on `redis` installed on the host.

On MacOS 10.15, start `redis`:

```bash
redis-server /usr/local/etc/redis.conf
```

On MacOS 12.4 (M1 / Arm64), start `redis`:

```bash
redis-server /opt/homebrew/etc/redis.conf
```

To start `arq` with reload capability:

```
arq api.worker.WorkerSettings --watch ./api
```

To start the API in development mode:

```
uvicorn api.api:app --reload --port 5000
```

### Staging / production environment or Docker setup

See `deploy/staging/README.md`.

## API requests

To make custom report requests using HTTPie:

```bash
http -f POST :5000/api/reports/custom token=="<token from .env>" name="<area name>" file@<filename>.zip
```

This creates a background job and returns:

```
{
    "job": "<job_id>"
}
```

To query job status:

```
http :5000/api/reports/status/<job_id>
```

To download PDF from a successful job:

```
http :5000/api/reports/results/<job_id>
```

This sets the `Content-Type` header to attachment and uses the passed-in name
for the filename.

To list queued and completed jobs:

```
http :5000/admin/jobs/status -a admin
```

Username is admin, password is `API_SECRET` in `.env`
