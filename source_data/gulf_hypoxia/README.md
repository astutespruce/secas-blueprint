# SECAS Southeast Conservation Blueprint Inputs - Gulf Hypoxia Precision Conservation Blueprint

Downloaded 10/8/2020 from SE Blueprint MS Teams site (input folder for SE Blueprint).

Metadata available here: https://lccnetwork.org/sites/default/files/Resources/ghi_conservation_blueprint_report.pdf

The Blueprint data are derived from the Conservation and Watershed Interests (sum)
layer.

Higher values indicate higher priority:
High conservation value = 5 through 8
Medium conservation value = 4

It is in the same projection as the SE Blueprint, but not grid aligned.

Processed using `analysis/prep/prepare_gulf_hypoxia.py`.
