# Wildfire Risk to Communities

Wildfire risk to communities data (RDS-2020-0016-2\_\_BP_CONUS.zip) were downloaded 12/18/2024 from https://www.fs.usda.gov/rds/archive/catalog/RDS-2020-0016-2.

The data were downloaded by state because the national dataset kept timing out.

Data were binned to match the Wildfire Risk to Communities website: https://wildfirerisk.org/explore/wildfire-likelihood/37/

Thresholds were provided by Eva Karau (USFS) to Hilary Morris on 12/17/2024 and shared via email.
