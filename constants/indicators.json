Areas of excellent fish habitat are already in good condition and face few threats.

Degraded areas of opportunity face many challenges, and restoration projects are unlikely to increase available fish habitat unless particularly large in scope and scale.

It also provides essential ecosystem services such as nutrient retention and downstream flood control. When parts of the floodplain stay constantly wet or dry, this may signal negative impacts from structures like dikes, dams, and levees, which disconnect waterbodies from their adjacent floodplains.

The first, landscape diversity, reflects the number of microhabitats and climatic gradients created by topography, elevation, and hydrology. The second, local connectedness, reflects the degree of habitat fragmentation and strength of barriers to species movement. Highly resilient sites contain many different habitat niches that support biodiversity, and allow species to move freely through the landscape to find suitable microclimates as the climate changes. This indicator originates from The Nature Conservancy's Resilient Land data.",
