<h2 id="About">About the Blueprint</h2>

<p>
    The Southeast Conservation Blueprint is the primary product of the
    Southeast Conservation Adaptation Strategy (SECAS). It is a living,
    spatial plan that identifies important areas for conservation and
    restoration across the Southeast and Caribbean. The Blueprint stitches
    together smaller subregional plans into one consistent map,
    incorporating the best available information about key species,
    ecosystems, and future threats. More than 1,700 people from 500
    different organizations have actively participated in its development
    so far.

    The Blueprint stitches together smaller subregional plans into one
    consistent map, incorporating the best available information about the
    current condition of key species and habitats, as well as future
    threats.

    Where these subregional plans overlap, the following rules were used:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Only include an input if known uses of that Blueprint input have
        occurred in the overlap zone
    </li>
    <li>
        If an overlap zone has no known use for any Blueprint input,
        only include the most well-established input
    </li>
</ul>
