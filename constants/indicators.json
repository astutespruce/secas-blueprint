Areas of excellent fish habitat are already in good condition and face few threats.

Degraded areas of opportunity face many challenges, and restoration projects are unlikely to increase available fish habitat unless particularly large in scope and scale.

When parts of the floodplain stay constantly wet or dry, this may signal negative impacts from structures like dikes, dams, and levees, which disconnect waterbodies from their adjacent floodplains.

River cane not only provides significant habitat value and ecosystem services, but many Southeastern Native American Tribes consider it a cultural keystone species important to the continuity of traditional lifeways.
