Hardbottom provides an anchor for important seafloor habitats such as deep-sea corals, plants, and sponges. Hardbottom and associated deep-sea coral communities provide valuable habitat structure that supports a wide range of invertebrate and fish species. This indicator combines multiple datasets from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and The Nature Conservancy.",

This ratio, and how it changes over time, is a good surrogate for salt marsh degradation processes like sediment loss and conversion to open water. It helps differentiate between stable marshes that are more resilient, and declining marshes that are more vulnerable to threats like sea-level rise, erosion, and coastal development. This indicator originates from a U.S. Geological Survey project on an unvegetated to vegetated ratio for coastal wetlands.",
