<h2 id="About">About the Southeast Blueprint</h2>

<p>
    The Southeast Conservation Blueprint is the primary product of the
    <a href="https://secassoutheast.org/">Southeast Conservation Adaptation Strategy</a>
    (SECAS). It is a living, spatial plan to achieve the SECAS vision of a
    connected network of lands and waters across the Southeast and Caribbean.
    The Blueprint is regularly updated to incorporate new data, partner input,
    and information about on-the-ground conditions.
    <br />
    <br />
    Across 15 states of the Southeast, the Blueprint identifies priority areas
    based on a suite of natural and cultural resource indicators representing
    terrestrial, freshwater, and marine ecosystems. A connectivity analysis
    identifies corridors that link coastal and inland areas and span climate
    gradients. This portion of the Southeast Blueprint is referred to as the
    "Base Blueprint".
    <br />
    <br />
    To provide more complete coverage of the SECAS geography, the Blueprint
    incorporates two additional input plans: the Florida Marine Blueprint for
    marine areas in Florida and the Caribbean Landscape Conservation Design for
    inland areas in Puerto Rico.
